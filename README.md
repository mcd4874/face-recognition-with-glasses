# face-recognition-with-glasses
The objective is to perform face recognition with or without eye glasses
there are three stages
1) we will project the glasses from an image onto a face image to generate dataset with glasses
2) create a CNN-auto encoder to remove glasses from face image without losing integrity
3) create a software application to perform face detection.
